## About The Project

**libssh2-labview** provides LabVIEW&trade; bindings for [libssh2](https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2).

### Limitations

Although this project aims to provide complete bindings for libssh2, there are several limitations users need to be aware of:

- When calling `libssh2_channel_read()` and `libssh2_channel_read_ex()`, the buffer length is limited to 2^31-1 bytes (2 GiB) instead of 2^32-1 bytes (4 GiB). The reason for this is that arrays in LabVIEW are limited to 3^31-1 elements. The function must be called in a loop in order to read more data.
- When calling `libssh2_channel_write()` and `libssh2_channel_write_ex()`, the buffer length is limited to 2^31-1 bytes (2 GiB) instead of 2^32-1 bytes (4 GiB). The reason for this is that arrays in LabVIEW are limited to 2^31-1 elements. The function must be called in a loop in order to write more data.

### Built With

* [LabVIEW&trade;](https://www.ni.com/labview)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* LabVIEW&trade; 2013 or later
* VI Package Manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/logmanoriginal/libssh2-labview.git
   ```

## Usage

Here is an example that uses libssh2-labview to execute a command on a remote SSH server.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Keep in mind that LabVIEW&trade; VIs are binary files, which are difficult to merge.
- Only change a single VI or library.
- Avoid conflicts with other pull requests (don't work on the same libraries or VIs).
- Send VI Snippets (via issues) instead of pull requests when possible.
